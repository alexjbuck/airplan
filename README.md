Writing airplan's in PowerPoint is a big bummer ðŸ¤¬.
Never again will you chained to dragging around little lines on the screen â›“.
This is a simple web app that allows you to view and edit your squadron's flight plans ðŸ“‹.
You can add new flights, edit existing flights, and delete flights. You can also export your squadron's flight plans to PDF.

Tips:

- To get started, click the blue  in the menu to add a new squadron.
- You can add cycles by clicking the "+ Add Cycle" button and providing the cycle times
- Next add an aircraft line by clicking the "+ Add Line" button.
- Sorties are added into a line by clicking "+ Add Sortie" within a line in the list.
- Save your airplan by clicking the  button. This will download a file that you can upload later to resume your progress.
- **Best Practice**: Add all of your squadrons, then save your airplan. Use that file as your starting point for the future.
- **Pro Tip**: View these tips anytime by clicking the  help icon in the menu.

Play around, you can't break anything, and hopefully you find this app useful!
